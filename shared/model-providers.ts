/**
 * The facts every Bot shares about the model providers it may be pointed at.
 *
 * One entry per provider, rather than the same default model, key variable and base URL variable
 * written out in each Bot. They were written out in each Bot, and they drifted: five files, five
 * different default OpenAI models, the first time somebody changed one of them in one place only.
 * A provider is added here; the Bots that speak its SDK take their names from this table.
 *
 * THE VALUES LIVE IN `model-providers.json`, beside this file. That file is the contract every
 * language in the box reads — TypeScript and Python through the loaders beside it, any other
 * language straight as JSON — so a developer adding a Bot in Java adds one entry there and never
 * reads this module. What the two loaders add to the file is types and validation: in either
 * loader, a row missing a field, a provider row the file lacks, a provider row that loader's list
 * has never heard of, or a `bots` entry naming a provider outside that list, stops the process at
 * startup with the path of the offending key rather than at the first model call.
 *
 * ENVIRONMENT BEATS FILE. `BOT_PROVIDER` and `BOT_MODEL` still win, exactly as
 * `docs/configuration.md` has always described; the file supplies what they leave unset. API keys
 * never appear in the file — they arrive in the environment under the `key_variable` the provider
 * row names.
 *
 * Facts only. Which provider a Bot can DRIVE is that Bot's own decision, beside the code that
 * loads its SDK: this module knows Google exists and what its key is called, and `agent-mastra`
 * still refuses it because it loads no Google module. Keeping the two apart is what lets a new
 * provider be registered here without pretending every harness can answer for it. The `bots`
 * section records what a Bot runs by default, not what it is able to drive.
 *
 * Its own module for the reason `model-key.ts` had to be one: `agent-bot` and `agent-langgraph`
 * call `serve()` at module scope, so importing a pure function from an entry point binds a port.
