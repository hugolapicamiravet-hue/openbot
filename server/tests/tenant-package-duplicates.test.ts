/**
 * A package that says the same thing twice.
 *
 * Sync writes one row per entry. Where that is one upsert per entry, a repeat silently became
 * whichever came last; where it is one multi-row INSERT, Postgres refused it and the server stopped
 * at boot with a SQL error naming no file. Each case is refused here instead, with a sentence that
 * says where the repeat is.
 *
 * Kept out of `tenant-package.test.ts` because everything here is validation, and that suite opens a
 * database at import.
