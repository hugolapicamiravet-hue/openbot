 * How this run differs from the ordinary one, which is the whole vocabulary these tests need.
 *
 * `shell` IS A PARAMETER BECAUSE THE INVOCATION IS PART OF WHAT IS UNDER TEST. `bash` is the
 * supported one and the one the docs name; `sh` is the one somebody reaches for out of habit, and
 * what it produced was exit 1 with no output at all.
 *
 * `omitFromEnv` IS THE OTHER HALF. Every key below has a default in the script, so a `.env` without
 * one is an ordinary `.env` rather than a broken one — `.env.example` does not list `APP_PORT` at
 * all.

   *
   * THIS ONE PASSED BEFORE THE CHANGE IT GUARDS, AND THAT IS SAID PLAINLY RATHER THAN DRESSED UP.
   * `setting` reads the key with a `grep` pipeline, `grep` finding nothing is an exit status of 1,
   * and `pipefail` makes it the pipeline's — but under bash that status does not escape the command
   * substitution, so the fallback won and this run was already green. It was fatal only under `sh`,
   * where the sibling test now keeps anybody from arriving at all. So there is no invocation left
   * that can watch this fail, and what it does instead is pin the CONTRACT: the second argument to
   * `setting` is the value an absent key takes, and nothing about which shell is reading the script
   * may decide otherwise.
   *
   * THE `|| true` IN THE SCRIPT IS WHAT MAKES THAT TRUE BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by a subtlety
   * of where `set -e` applies. Both halves are worth having: the refusal stops the invocation that
   * was silently fatal, and this stops the fallback depending on a detail nobody should have to
   * know to add a setting.
   *
   * `APP_PORT` IS THE ONE OMITTED BECAUSE IT IS THE REAL CASE. `.env.example` lists `PORT` and
   * `SERVER_PORT` and not this one, so every `.env` copied from it is missing exactly this key, and
   * it is the first setting the script reads — which is why the silent exit under `sh` happened
   * before any output at all.
   *
   * THE ASSERTION IS THE WHOLE RUN rather than a printed port: the faked `curl` answers the app
   * probe for `http://localhost:3010/` and nothing else, so a fallback that produced any other port
   * fails the run instead of quietly reporting a different number.
